Maddo's Vim Settings
--------------------

To use this configuration exactly as it is (in win/mac), clone it into 
~/.vim (backup your current .vim if it exists).

Create a link for the .vimrc file, something like this:
cd ~
ln -s .vim/.vimrc .vimrc

And create a file for local customizations
touch ~/vimrc_local

The git contains several plugins ready to go:
-NERDTree
-ScrollColor
-assistant
-debugger
(This list may change or grow over time)

Otherwise, browse the files and pick and choose useful elements.

Mac users:
If not already configured, there's a tweak for git to help with line 
ending issues.

git config --global core.autocrlf input
